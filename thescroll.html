I wrote this for a traveller on BeWelcome who asked me for Madrid recommendations. Storing here for anyone else. (Last updated 02/23)
<ul>
<li>Bars:
Sala Equis: (Cinema bar- busy but definitely worth a visit)
Cuevas de Sesamo : Sangria in a basement with a piano.
La Venencia - "The one bar you must visit if you come to Madrid". A sherry bar. Looks like a working museum. No photos allowed.
Daaraji: Senegalese bar in Lavapiés run by a lovely guy called Papi who imports textiles. Great decor.
El Pavón: Bar attached to a theatre in Lavapiés with a beautiful wooden ceiling. Lot of artists and actors.
El Mercado San Fernando: Unlike the best-known mercados in Madrid this one isn't expensive. Very busy on weekends.
Barbieri : Parisian-looking bar in Lavapiés. Wrought iron columns, chequered floor, red velvet sofas. Great at any time of day/night. (Bar Manuela in Malasaña has a very similar vibe but with added boardgames)</li>

Food:
Lamiak: Basque bar with two locales in Lavapiés and La Latina. Incredible pinchos (vegetarian and fish options available).
El Mercado San Fernando: (as mentioned above). Food from all over the world, reasonably priced and very good.
If you're a  meat eater visit El Rincón De Manolo for Asturian steak/other delicacies.
Croqueta Solo: Croqueta-only restaurant in barrio de las letras. Relaxed, good place for a quick bite.
Canastaco: Brilliant Mexican taco restaurant in a mercado in Delicias (close to Madrid Río). Not well-known yet.

<li>Parks: 
El Retiro: Goes without saying. It is a must-see.
Templo De Debod: Slice of an egyptian temple given to Spain after an international UNESCO project. They mounted it facing the sunset and it's a good walk to combine with the palace and the cathedral. Lot of people visit at sundown, musicians etc.
Parque Madrid Río: A riverside walk/park that stretches for a few kilometres. Can be combined with a visit to La Capilla de Goya and El Mercado Puerta del Angel.</li>

<li>Galleries :
El Reina Sofia - Free every day for two hours, I think between 7 and 9pm.
El Prado - Free every day for two hours, I think between 6 and 8pm.
El Thyssen -  Free on Mondays between 12 and 4pm.
La Capilla Pintada de Goya - This isn't known anywhere near as much as it should be. It's a chapel painted by the artist Goya. It’s also where he is buried, and it's free to visit. <em>Check website times. They might have changed recently</em></li>
