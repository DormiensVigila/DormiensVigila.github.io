  <b>Bars:</b>
<ul>
<li>Sala Equis: (Cinema bar- busy but definitely worth a visit)</li>
<li>Cuevas de Sesamo : Sangria in a basement with a piano.</li>
<li>La Venencia - "The one bar you must visit if you come to Madrid". A sherry bar. Looks like a working museum. No photos allowed.</li>
<li>Daaraji: Senegalese bar/textiles shop in Lavapiés. Hypnotic furnishings.</li>
<li>Bar attached to a theatre in Lavapiés with a beautiful wooden ceiling. Lot of artists and actors.</li>El Pavón: 
<li>El Mercado San Fernando: Unlike the best-known mercados in Madrid this one isn't expensive. Very busy on weekends.</li>
<li>Barbieri : Parisian-looking bar in Lavapiés. Wrought iron columns, chequered floor, red velvet sofas. Great at any time of day/night. (Bar Manuela in Malasaña has a very similar vibe but with a big collection of boardgames).</li>
 </ul>

  <b>Food:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lamiak: Basque bar with two locales in Lavapiés and La Latina. Incredible pinchos (vegetarian and fish options available).</li>
<li>El Mercado San Fernando: (as mentioned above). Food from all over the world, reasonably priced and very good. If you're a  meat eater visit El Rincón De Manolo for Asturian steak/other delicacies.</li>
<li>Croqueta Solo: Croqueta-only restaurant in barrio de las letras. Relaxed, good place for a quick bite.</li>
<li>Canastaco:Brilliant Mexican taco restaurant in a mercado in Delicias (close to Madrid Río). Not well-known yet. Excellent meat options but very little for vegetarians here.</li>
</ul>

  <b>Parks:</b>
<ul> 
<li>El Retiro: Goes without saying. It is a must-see.</li>
<li>Templo De Debod: Slice of an egyptian temple given to Spain after an international UNESCO project. They mounted it facing the sunset and it's a good walk to combine with the palace and the cathedral. Lot of people visit at sundown, musicians etc.</li>
<li>Parque Madrid Río: A riverside walk/park that stretches for a few kilometres. Can be combined with a visit to La Capilla de Goya and El Mercado Puerta del Angel.</li>
</ul>

  <b>Galleries:</b>
<ul>
<li> La Reina Sofia - Free every day for two hours, I think between 7 and 9pm.</li>
<li>El Prado - Free every day for two hours, I think between 6 and 8pm.</li>
<li>El Thyssen -  Free on Mondays between 12 and 4pm.</li>
<li>La Capilla Pintada de Goya - This isn't known anywhere near as much as it should be. It's a chapel painted by the artist Goya. It’s also where he is buried, and it's free to visit.</li>
</ul>
