<em>A quick list of recs for visitors to Madrid. I live in Lavapiés, so it's pretty Lavapiés-centric. Last updated 02/23.</em>

<b>Bars:</b>
<ul>
<li>Sala Equis: (Cinema bar- busy but definitely worth a visit)</li>
<li>Cuevas de Sesamo : Sangria in a basement with a piano.</li>
<li>La Venencia - "The one bar you must visit if you come to Madrid". A sherry bar. Looks like a working museum. No photos allowed.</li>
<li>Daaraji: Senegalese bar/textiles shop in Lavapiés. Hypnotic furnishings.</li>
<li>El Pavón: Bar attached to a theatre in Lavapiés with a beautiful wooden ceiling. Lot of artists and actors.</li> 
<li>El Mercado San Fernando: Unlike the best-known mercados in Madrid this one isn't expensive. Very busy on weekends.</li>
<li>Barbieri : Parisian-looking bar in Lavapiés. Wrought iron columns, chequered floor, red velvet sofas. Great at any time of day/night. (Bar Manuela in Malasaña has a very similar vibe but with a big collection of boardgames).</li>
 </ul>

  <b>Food:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lamiak: Basque bar with two locales in Lavapiés and La Latina. Incredible pinchos (vegetarian and fish options available).</li>
<li>El Mercado San Fernando: (as mentioned above). Food from all over the world, reasonably priced and very good. If you're a  meat eater visit El Rincón De Manolo for Asturian steak/other delicacies.</li>
<li>Croqueta Solo: Croqueta-only restaurant in barrio de las letras. Relaxed, good place for a quick bite.</li>
<li>Canastaco:Brilliant Mexican taco restaurant in a mercado in Delicias (close to Madrid Río). Not well-known yet. Excellent meat options but very little for vegetarians here.</li>
<li>Bombay Blue: At the end of calle Miguel Servet in Lavapiés. Best curry restaurant in Madrid.</li>
<li>Los Tres Cerditos:Famously popular Chinese dumplings. One location in Delicias and the other in La Latina.</li>


</ul>

  <b>Parks:</b>
<ul> 
<li>El Retiro: Goes without saying. It is a must-see.</li>
<li>Templo De Debod: Slice of an egyptian temple given to Spain after an international UNESCO project. They mounted it facing the sunset and it's a good walk to combine with the palace and the cathedral. Lot of people visit at sundown, musicians etc.</li>
<li>Parque Madrid Río: A riverside walk/park that stretches for a few kilometres. Can be combined with a visit to La Capilla de Goya and El Mercado Puerta del Angel.</li>
<li> Parque El Oeste: By Moncloa at the end of Metro Line 3. Just as well landscaped as El Retiro but with half the visitors. Perfect for picnics. I actually have a friend who gives a brilliant historical walking tour of Madrid, focusing on this park and the surrounding area in the time of the Spanish Civil War. <a href= "https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/38841-the-battle-for-madrid-legacy-of-the-spanish-republic">Link.</a href>
<li> Casa De Campo: Former royal hunting grounds. Covers a gigantic area and shows you a more realistic example of the natural tree species of the area (a lot of quercus ilex, for example). Also has a lake and some (expensive) bars.</li>
<li>Parque Tierno Galván: Another favourite. A park in Delicias next to El Museo De Los Motores. Mix of industrial open spaces (train tracks, water towers, coliseums) and manicured lawns with fountains. Great for a medium sized walk. Keep an eye out for the abandoned imax cinema.</li>
</ul>

  <b>Galleries:</b>
<ul>
<li> La Reina Sofia - Free every day for two hours, I think between 7 and 9pm.</li>
<li>El Prado - Free every day for two hours, I think between 6 and 8pm.</li>
<li>El Thyssen -  Free on Mondays between 12 and 4pm.</li>
<li>La Capilla Pintada de Goya - This isn't known anywhere near as much as it should be. It's a chapel painted by the artist Goya. It’s also where he is buried, and it's free to visit.</li>
</ul>
