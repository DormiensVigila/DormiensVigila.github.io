<em>"There is change, and departure: but there is also help when least looked for from the strangers of the day, and hiding, out among the accidents of this drifting Humility, never quite to be extinguished, a few small chances for mercy."</em> - Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow
<br/>
<em>"The present life of man, O king, seems to me, in comparison of that time which is unknown to us, like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper in winter, with your commanders and ministers, and a good fire in the midst, whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad; the sparrow, I say, flying in at one door, and immediately out at another, whilst he is within, is safe from the wintry storm; but after a short space of fair weather, he immediately vanishes out of your sight, into the dark winter from which he had emerged. So this life of man appears for a short space, but of what went before, or what is to follow, we are utterly ignorant."</em> - The Venerable Bede

<p>I’ve been hitchhiking on and off for about 15 years now.<br/>
 Here’s where you’ll find my trip notes (more to be uploaded as I digitise them).<br/>
 If you want to know more about how to hitchhike, I recommend visiting <a href="https://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page">Hitchwiki</a> and reading everything in the ‘how to hitchhike’ section (or if you want to know my methods, read <a class="nav-link" href="#Precipitating_Luck_2019">‘Precipitating Luck’<a/>).<br/><p/>
